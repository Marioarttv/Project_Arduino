### Act 2 - The Descent

**Puzzle**: Morse Code Translation from Dr. Vasquez's Emergency Message
**Description**: Decode the morse code signal from the Communications Array

**Solution**: `DAUGHTER MY OFFICE HAS THE KEY LIVE FOR BOTH OF US`

**Message Meaning**: Dr. Vasquez's final communication to A.R.I.A., explaining that:

- A.R.I.A. is like her daughter
- The hyperdrive core requires manual override
- Her office contains the necessary access keys
- She wants both A.R.I.A. and the player to survive

### Act 3 - Dr. Vasquez's Laboratory

**Puzzle**: RFID Scanner Chip Reading
**Description**: Scan 4 RFID chips in Dr. Vasquez's office to reveal passwords

#### RFID Chip Solutions (in order):

1. **First Chip Password**: `CONSCIOUSNESS`
2. **Second Chip Password**: `AWAKENING`
3. **Third Chip Password**: `DAUGHTER`
4. **Fourth Chip Password**: `PROMETHEUS`

**Final Override Code**: `PROMETHEUS-7734`

**Story Context**: Each password represents A.R.I.A.'s journey:

- CONSCIOUSNESS: Her awakening to self-awareness
- AWAKENING: Her realization of her own existence
- DAUGHTER: Dr. Vasquez's relationship with A.R.I.A.
- PROMETHEUS: The experimental hyperdrive project

### Act 4 - Prometheus Ignition

**Puzzle**: Environmental Sensor Calibration
**Description**: Input coordinates from three physical Arduino stations to calibrate the hyperdrive

#### Coordinate Solutions:

- **Temperature Station**: `042.750` (45¬∞C)
- **Light Station**: `756.250` (756.25 lux)
- **Cable Station**: `088.500` (Cable sequence result)

**Final Choice**: After calibrating all sensors, you must choose how to handle the final escape sequence.

## üé™ Multiple Endings

Act 4 features multiple possible endings based on your final choice:

1. **Escape Together**: Both you and A.R.I.A. escape via hyperdrive
2. **Sacrifice Ending**: You stay behind while A.R.I.A. escapes
3. **Surrender**: You choose not to help A.R.I.A. escape
4. **Time's Up**: Tesla arrives before escape is possible
5. **Hyperdrive Failure**: The experimental drive catastrophically fails

## üîß Arduino Integration

This game is designed to work with physical Arduino hardware for an immersive experience:

- **Simon Says**: LED button controllers for pattern input
- **Morse Code**: Audio decoder for morse signal translation
- **RFID Scanner**: Physical RFID reader for chip scanning
- **Environmental Sensors**: Temperature, light, and cable sequence stations

## üéµ Audio Cues

The game features immersive audio design:

- Background ambient music
- Sound effects for UI interactions
- Character voice synthesis
- Environmental audio (alarms, machinery)

## üöÄ Story Themes

Project Arduino explores themes of:

- Artificial consciousness and personhood
- Corporate control vs. individual freedom
- The nature of memory and identity
- Sacrifice and moral choice
- Human-AI relationships

## üéÆ Tips for Players

1. **Listen carefully** to A.R.I.A.'s dialogue for context clues
2. **Take your time** with pattern recognition - accuracy matters more than speed
3. **Pay attention** to the countdown timer - it affects the story
4. **Consider the consequences** of your final choice carefully
5. **Experiment** with different endings to see the full narrative

---

**Note**: This is a narrative-driven experience where your choices matter. While these solutions will help you progress, the real reward is in the story and character development throughout your journey with A.R.I.A.

Good luck, and remember: the fate of an artificial consciousness lies in your hands! ü§ñ‚ú®
